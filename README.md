# BabylonJs Angular App

## Description

The BabylonJs Angular App is a basic tool for working with 3D geometries. It allows users to extrude 2D polygons into 3D objects, move and manipulate objects, and edit vertices of 3D geometries. Whether you're a 3D modeling enthusiast, a game developer, or just curious about the world of 3D, this app provides the features you need for your projects.

## Features

The BabylonJs Angular App boasts a range of features:

- **Draw 2D Polygons**: Use the Draw Service to make linear 2D shapes.

- **Extrude 3D Polygons**: Use the Extrude Service to take 2D shapes and turn them into 3D objects. Make your geometries pop!

- **Move and Interact with Objects**: The Move Service allows you to select and interact with 3D objects. Move them with ease. A handy gizmo makes translation a breeze.

- **Edit Vertices**: With the Edit-Vertex Service, you can fine-tune the vertices of your geometries. Make precise adjustments to achieve the shape you desire.(In Progress)

## Installation

Getting started with the BabylonJs Angular App is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the app's repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Use npm to install them.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the App**: Start the app with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now you're ready to start using the 3D Geometry Interaction App.

## Usage

Using the app is intuitive, and I've designed it to be user-friendly. Here are some basic usage instructions:

2. **Draw 2D Polygons**:

    - Left-click to start drawing a 2D polygon.
    - Right-click to finish the 2D polygon.

2. **Extrude 3D Polygons**:

    - Click on a 2D polygon.
    - Watch as it transforms into a 3D object with the Extrude Service.

3. **Move and Interact with Objects**:

    - Click on a 3D object to select it.
    - Use the gizmo to move, rotate, or scale the object.
    - De-select by right-clicking or selecting another object.

4. **Edit Vertices**:

    - Select a geometry.
    - Use the Edit-Vertex Service to manipulate individual vertices.
    - Achieve precise adjustments for your 3D shapes.

## Services

The app consists of several services, each serving a unique purpose:

- **Draw Service**: For drawing 2D linear geometries.

- **Extrude Service**: For creating 3D geometries by extruding 2D polygons.
  
- **Move Service**: To select, move 3D objects with ease.
  
- **Edit-Vertex Service**: For precise vertex editing and customization.
